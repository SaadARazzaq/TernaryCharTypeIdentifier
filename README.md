# TernaryCharTypeIdentifier

This is a small C++ program that demonstrates how to identify and classify character types using the ternary operator. Main focus is to implement Ternary Operator

## Description

It showcases the usage of the ternary operator in a concise and efficient manner to perform character type identification. Just wanted to show that ternary operators can also be used in C++ rather than always using If-else statements.

## Features

- Identifies and classifies character types: uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.

## Usage

1. Compile the program using a C++ compiler of your choice.
2. Run the compiled executable.
3. Enter a character when prompted.
4. The program will output the type of the entered character.

## Example Output

    Enter Character: (Case sensitive)
    S
    Uppercase Character
